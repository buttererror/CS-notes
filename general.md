The most common case types are:
* Camel Case (camelCase): The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized (e.g., firstName, calculateTotalPrice). This is widely used for variable and function names in languages like JavaScript, Java, and C#.
* Pascal Case (PascalCase): Similar to camel case, but the first letter of every word, including the first one, is capitalized (e.g., FirstName, CalculateTotalPrice). This is typically used for naming classes and types in languages such as C#, Java, and Python.
* Snake Case (snake_case): Words are separated by underscores (_), and all letters are typically in lowercase (e.g., first_name, calculate_total_price). This is the preferred style for variable and function names in Python and Ruby.
* Kebab Case (kebab-case): Words are separated by hyphens (-), and all letters are in lowercase (e.g., first-name, calculate-total-price). This is commonly used in web development for CSS classes, HTML IDs, and URLs. It is generally discouraged in most programming languages as the hyphen can be interpreted as a subtraction operator.
* Screaming Snake Case (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE): All letters are in uppercase, with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_CONNECTIONS, API_KEY). This convention is typically used for defining constants and environment variables in many languages.
